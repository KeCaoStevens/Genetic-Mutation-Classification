# Genetic-Mutation-Classification
Although such promising expectation that advancing our
understanding of cancer and designing more efficient, effective
and precise treatments has been stimulated by genetic testing,
the examination of genetic role is still slow because of
significant amount of manual work. Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center (MSKCC), in the past several years, has worked
to create an expert-annotated precision oncology knowledge
base. Thousand annotations of which genes are clinical actionable
and which are not based on clinical literature have
been complied. MSKCC launched a competition, accepted by
the NIPS 2017 Competition Track, to develop classification
models which analyze abstracts of medical articles and, based
on their content accurately determine oncogenicity (4 classes)
and mutation effect (9 classes) of the genes discussed in them.
Once sequenced, There are thousands of genetic mutation
a cancer tumor can have. The challenge is to discriminate the
mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the
neutral mutations (passengers), which are interpreted manually.
A clinical pathologist review and classify every single
genetic mutation based on evidence from clinical literature.
For this competition MSKCC is making available an expertannotated
knowledge base where world-class researchers and
oncologists have manually annotated thousands of mutations.
Machine Learning algorithms are developed and discussed in
this paper, which used the precision oncology knowledge base
as a baseline, to automatically classify genetic variations.
